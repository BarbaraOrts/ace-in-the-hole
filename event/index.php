        <h2>Other events course details</h2>
        <h3 class="textred">Try-A-Tri</h3>
        <p>This novice race is designed for the first time triathlete, those new to the sport, our Junior Triathletes.
            The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance
            swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a
            flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).</p>
        <h3 class="textred">Half Marathon (13.1 miles)</h3>
        <p>Half-Marathon event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. Once
            finished, runners can enjoy the finish line festivities, including the Sports & Fitness Expo and live
            entertainment. Post-race refreshments will be provided and the Awards Ceremony for the Half-Marathon will
            begin once the results have been certified</p>
        <h3 class="textred">10k</h3>
        <p>The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly
            paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain
            to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.</p>
        <h3 class="textred">Splash n' Dash</h3>
        <p>Kids event for participants ages 4 to 15. This is a 100 yard swim and a 50 yard dash. It is free if an adult
            registers for an event otherwise it is $25</p>

        <h2>What to bring</h2>
        <p>You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event. You will be given a band that will hold your
            chip timing piece around your ankle throughout the entire event. Be sure that it is snapped tightly. Be sure
            to have your Chip Timing piece on before you start the race and be sure to step over the timing mats after
            each segment of the race. If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes under your wetsuit
            otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting off your wet suit.</p>
        <p>Remember to bring a change of clothing so you can enjoy the post-event festivities.</p>

        <p>Check out the requirements below:</p>


        <dl>

            <dt>Swim</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth. However, many people opt for
                    no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries. We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to
                    bring your own goggles.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Bike</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>A biking helmet is mandatory. You will also receive 2 stickers in your package with your race number
                    on them. The small sticker should go on the front of your helmet. The bigger sticker will wrap
                    around your bike frame. Road or mountain bikes are acceptable. For safety reasons, be sure to have
                    end-caps on the end of your handle-bars.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Run</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of you. Some people choose to pin it on at
                    the beginning of the race and have it on for the whole event so they don't have to worry about it.
                    Others pin it on a singlet that they put on once they finish the swim before they head out for the
                    bike. Others use an elastic racing strap that they pin their bib number to and then quickly strap it
                    on before they leave for the run. Use whatever option feels best for you.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <dl>

            <dt>What are the Rules?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>We currently adhere to the USAT Rules for Triathlon & Duathlon. Important rules include no drafting,
                    you must wear a helmet and music is ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed during the bike for obvious safety
                    reasons.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Can I use a personal music device while cycling?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Absolutely no music devices are allowed during the bike segment for obvious safety risks and will
                    result in immediate disqualification.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Can I use a personal music device while running?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>During any running segments, we prefer for athletes to NOT use music devices to maximize safety,
                    assure a fair competitive environment and assure athletes can hear all course marshal instructions.
                    With that said, we also understand that many athletes rely on music to help endure the challenge of
                    running. To accommodate the needs of our athletes while still assuring maximum safety and a fair,
                    competitive environment, here is the arrangement that we can accommodate:</p>
                <ul class="faq">
                    <li>If you chose to use a personal music device, you must always keep one ear open for instructions
                        so only one ear-bud can be used at any time. In addition, if you opt to use music, you will not
                        be eligible for awards, points and rankings. So as an athlete, you have to make a choice - music
                        or awards/points/rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you are using a personal music devise with two earbuds, you will be immediately disqualified.
                        Trust us, we don't want to have to enforce a disqualification but in order to assure the safety
                        of all athletes, this is a very important rule.
                    </li>
                    <li>We also request that if you chose to use a personal music device that you keep the volume to a
                        minimum to assure all instructions can be heard.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Do I need to wear a wetsuit?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>No, you do not need to wear a wetsuit. Many will not wear a wetsuit while others will choose to wear
                    a wetsuit because of the buoyancy and warmth factor. WATER TEMPERATURE is expected to be between 62
                    & 66 degrees. The temperature will be taken on Friday and the
                    morning of the race. Wetsuits are recommended.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>Do I have to use a road or racing bike?</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>No. We welcome any type of bike as long as it is functioning properly with brakes and endcaps at the
                    end of your handlebars.
                </p>
