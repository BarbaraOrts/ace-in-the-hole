        <h2>About the event </h2>
        <p>The Annual Ace in the Hole Multisport Weekend is a legendary event in the Oregon triathlon and running
            community. It has become a traditional destination race for athletes from across the nation.

            There is something for every level of athletic ability. The weekend includes a first timer triathlon, a
            sprint, Olympic, and Half-Iron triathlons and 10K and Half marathon runs. Come to experience your first race
            or come to compete to win, but make sure you come to have fun!</p>
        <h2>Course details</h2>
        <p>WATER TEMPERATURE is expected to be between 62 & 66 degrees. The temperature will be taken on Friday and the
            morning of the race. Wetsuits are recommended.

            Long Course SWIM - 1.2mi - Participants will make two counter-clockwise loops. Large buoys will mark the
            turn points. Kayakers will be positioned on the water to support the swimmers. Medical support will be
            present on the beach.

            Long Course BIKE - 58 Miles: A scenic point-to-point course that travels over gently rolling hills prior to
            three hard climbs. The bike course will be marked with large directional signage and there will be course
            marshals at key intersections to help direct you.

            Long Course RUN - 13.1mi - A mostly flat loop course on widely paved bike paths that traverse through and
            around this beautiful and scenic destination resort (two hills total with a minimal elevation gain).

            OLYMPIC SWIM - 1,500 meters - Participants will make two counter-clockwise loops. Large buoys will mark the
            turn points. Kayakers will be positioned on the water to support the swimmers. Medical support will be
            present on the beach.

            OLYMPIC BIKE - 28mi - A scenic point-to-point course that travels over gently rolling hills. The bike course
            will be marked with large directional signage and course marshals will be present at key intersections.

            OLYMPIC RUN - 10K - A mostly flat loop course on widely paved bike paths that traverse through and around
            this beautiful and scenic destination resort (one hill total with a minimal elevation gain).

            Sprint: Course will offer a 1-loop 1/2 mile swim, the exact same 28 mile Bike Course as the Olympic distance
            and a 5km run.

            Try-A-Tri: This novice race is designed for the first time triathlete, those new to the sport, our Junior
            Triathletes. The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile
            Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator
            friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).

            Half Marathon COURSE: Half-Marathon (13.1-miles): Half-Marathon event starts and finishes in the Athletes
            Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. Once finished, runners can enjoy the finish line
            festivities, including the Sports & Fitness Expo and live entertainment. Post-race refreshments will be
            provided and the Awards Ceremony for the Half-Marathon will begin once the results have been certified

            10k COURSE: The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft
            wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a
            minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.

            Splash n' Dash: Kids event for participants ages 4 to 15. This is a 100 yard swim and a 50 yard dash. It is
            free if an adult registers for an event otherwise it is $25</p>

        <h2>What to bring</h2>
        <p>You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event. You will be given a band that will hold your
            chip timing piece around your ankle throughout the entire event. Be sure that it is snapped tightly. Be sure
            to have your Chip Timing piece on before you start the race and be sure to step over the timing mats after
            each segment of the race. If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes under your wetsuit
            otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting off your wet suit.

            Swim: Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth. However, many people opt for
            no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries. We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to bring
            your own goggles.

            Bike: A biking helmet is mandatory. You will also receive 2 stickers in your package with your race number
            on them. The small sticker should go on the front of your helmet. The bigger sticker will wrap around your
            bike frame. Road or mountain bikes are acceptable. For safety reasons, be sure to have end-caps on the end
            of your handle-bars.

            Run: You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of you. Some people choose to pin it on at
            the beginning of the race and have it on for the whole event so they don't have to worry about it. Others
            pin it on a singlet that they put on once they finish the swim before they head out for the bike. Others use
            an elastic racing strap that they pin their bib number to and then quickly strap it on before they leave for
            the run. Use whatever option feels best for you.

            Remember to bring a change of clothing so you can enjoy the post-event festivities.
